# Address Book Management - Frontend

This project is an extension of the Ruoyi framework, adding an Address Book management module. Users can access the Address Book interface from the main page, where they can manage contact information through a pop-up interface.

## Features

- **Access Address Book**: From the main page, users can open the Address Book interface, which appears as a pop-up window showing a list of contacts.

- Add New Contact

	: Click the "Add New Contact" button to open a form and input new contact details, including:

	- **Name**: The name of the contact.
	- **Phone Number**: The contact's phone number.
	- **Email**: The contact's email address.
	- **Company**: The company the contact works for.
	- **Position**: The contact's position in the company.
	- **Remarks**: Additional information or notes about the contact.

- **Edit Contact**: Click the "Edit" button next to a contact to modify their information. This allows updating the contact's details as needed.

- **Delete Contact**: Click the "Delete" button to remove a contact from the list. This action permanently deletes the contact's information from the Address Book.

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to the Address Book**: On the main page of the Ruoyi framework, locate and open the Address Book module from the sidebar menu.
2. **Add Contacts**: Use the "Add New Contact" button to create a new contact entry, filling out all required fields.
3. **Edit Contacts**: Select a contact from the list and click "Edit" to update their details.
4. **Delete Contacts**: Use the "Delete" button to remove unwanted contacts from the Address Book.

## Requirements

- Ensure that the Ruoyi framework is set up and running.
- This module is an extension of the existing Ruoyi framework, so it requires the framework as a base.
